                Many potential blood donors believe that they can’t donate blood due to medical or other reasons. But whether you’ve heard or read information about blood donation restrictions or been turned down in the past, please do not self defer. You may be able to say “Yes I can!” and share your power through lifesaving blood donations.<br>
                <br>Donating blood is a safe, quick, and easy way to help doctors and nurses save lives. However, not everyone may be able to give blood. Donating blood is a great way of saving people’s lives. The criteria for donating blood allow most of the population to donate regularly. Local blood banks have information on how many blood donors they need and how the process of donating works.<br>
