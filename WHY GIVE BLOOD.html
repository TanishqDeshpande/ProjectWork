                Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.<br>
                There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.<br>
                <br>
                Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:<br>
                <br>
                1) women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth.<br>
                2) children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition.<br>
                3) people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters.<br>
                4) many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.<br>
                <br>
                <u><h2>Advantages of Donating Blood</h2></u>
                <br>
                Donating blood has benefits for your emotional and physical health. According to a report by the Mental Health Foundation, helping others can:<br>
                <br>
                (i)   reduce stress.<br>
                (ii)  improve your emotional well-being.<br>
                (iii) benefit your physical health.<br>
                (iv)  help get rid of negative feelings.<br>
                (v)   provide a sense of belonging and reduce isolation.<br>
