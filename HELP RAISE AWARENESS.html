                The more the merrier! Frequent blood Donors assure us that they feel physically rejuvenated and mentally more fulfilled after every blood donation. There are also reports that it is good to donate blood regularly to prevent some heart diseases. In spite of all the above advantages and probably due to lack of awareness about blood donation, still only about 5% of eligible Donors donate blood.<br>
                 <br>
